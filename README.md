# Large-Scale Programming Course Projects

Welcome to the Large-Scale Programming course projects repository! In this repository, you will find the projects related to the course, along with instructions, guidelines, and resources to help you successfully complete them.

## Repo Overview

This repo focuses on advancing your programming skills by working with large-scale software projects. Through practical hands-on experience, you will learn how to organize software effectively, optimize for space and time efficiencies, debug efficiently, and utilize version control tools like Git.

### Goals

- Organize software into classes and functions to create better abstractions.
- Improve space-time efficiencies using appropriate data structures and parallelization techniques.
- Utilize Makefiles for compiling and managing dependencies.
- Debug effectively using GDB.
- Implement version control using Git for collaboration and code management.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the course projects, ensure that you are familiar with the following concepts:

- Git: Version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- GDB: GNU Debugger for debugging programs written in C, C++, and other languages.
- Make: Build automation tool used for compiling and managing software projects.
- Perf: Performance analysis tool for Linux systems.
- Bash: Unix shell and command language for scripting and automation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course projects, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment on a UNIX-based system (preferably Linux). If you're using a Windows machine, consider dual-booting or using a virtual machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
3. Review the project instructions and guidelines provided in each project directory.
4. Start working on the projects, following the best practices and concepts learned till now.

Happy coding!
